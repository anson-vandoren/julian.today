        <h2>What is this site?</h2>
        <p>
          I frequently need to know what today's Julian Date is. I got tired of
          always Googling <code>"julian date"</code>, clicking over to image
          search, and tracing across and down a table to figure it out. So I
          made this instead.

        <h2>But this isn't what Julian Date means!</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, thanks. I'm aware that the term is technically incorrect, and I
          should call it the "ordinal day" or "day of the year" instead. But in
          my current job (systems engineering, working with software folks a
          lot), and my previous job (working with the U.S. military), it was
          commonly referred to as Julian Date anyway.
        </p>

          Unless you're an astronomer, historian, or pedant, you probably
          understood I meant day of the year when I said Julian Date. If you are
          one of the above, this site is probably not much use to you.

        <h2>Other sites already do this...</h2>
        <p>
          I'm sure they do. But they don't have a URL that I'll always remember,
          and they usually don't read particularly well on a phone-sized screen.
          Plus they have a bunch of other content to wade through that I don't
          need, as well as tracking cookies, too much Javascript, ads I block
          anyway...
        </p>

          It mostly comes down to me being lazy, and wanting the simplest thing
          possible that works exactly how I want it.
